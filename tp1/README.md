## Presentation of the app

MyBibliotheque is a very simple app which displays some medias (films, books, sports...). It is composed of 3 menus: Home, Media and About. Different features are available:
- like a media (1)
- filter medias based on their type: films, books, sports (2)
- filter medias based on your likes (3)
- get the number of likes (4)
- get more data on the media (5)

(1) Click on the heart icon of a media in the Media menu. The heart is filled when the media is liked. You can dislike a media by clicking another time on the heart icon. <br />
(2) Select or unselect checkboxes at the top of the Media menu. <br />
(3) Select the checkbox "Medias aimés". It will display all liked medias with types chosen with feature <br />
(4) The number of likes is displayed in the Home page. <br />
(5) Long press a media and a popup with more data will be displayed. You can activate your vibration mode to have a sensitive little vibration.
